# Storyline ...

Our sacred BuildingBloCS logo has been stolen! And the culprit is currently still at large somewhere in BuildingBloCS land :scream:

Based on CCTV footage and evidence, the following deductions can be made:
- woman who **seems to be in her 20s** (Age 20 to 30)
- **does not have brown or black eyes**.
- she also seems to be wearing her work attire, but it was not clearly shown. Since she was in a pink top, she seems to be **either from one of these companies**:
  ```
  PRINTSPAN, TECHMANIA, NEPTIDE, MULTRON, SKYNET, UPDAT, STANTON
  ```
- one of her **friends' name starts with C** (you got this information from the sacred god of BuildingBloCS :bow:)

Being the ONE AND ONLY data master in BuildingBloCS land and have all information about all civilians here (stored in the names.json file). Can you use the gathered evidence to narrow down who the culprit may be? And as the police officers in BuildingBloCS land is extremely lazy, you can only provide them with the name of the culprit (not even the \_id of the person).


The fate of BuildingBloCS land lies in your hands. :exclamation::exclamation::exclamation:

**Code Snippets have been uploaded but full answers would only be uploaded after the workshop**

Additional Practice (not covered in this workshop but feel free to submit your work @ URL and ask questions in the Discord channels when in doubt):
- Find out whether any other person in names.json has at least one common friend as the culprit (names match exactly)
- Find out the number of people in names.json that has the same `favoriteFruit` as the culprit (excluding the culprit)
- Come up with your own questions :grin:
