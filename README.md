# BBCS-X-NoSQL




Hello! Welcome to BuildingBloCS 2020 NoSQL Workshop!

For this workshop, we would be using:
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com) as a remote server database for storing our data
- [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io) as a online environment to run our code (as gitpod allows for some usage of terminal commands which we will be using later for importing our json file to the MongoDB server)

---

Before we begin, we would need to download MongoDB. In order to do this in Gitpod, we would need to configure  `.gitpod.dockerfile ` and `.gitpod.yml` files to use the dedicated MongoDB image built on top of gitpod/workspace-full.

Simply add the following line to .gitpod.dockerfile:

```
FROM gitpod/workspace-mongodb
```

Add the following line to .gitpod.yml:

```image:
  file: .gitpod.dockerfile
```
  
Then start the MongoDB server by running this in a Terminal or in a .gitpod.yml command:
mkdir -p /workspace/data && mongod --dbpath /workspace/data
Note: Storing MongoDBâ€™s data inside /workspace ensures that it will get backed up and restored properly when you stop and restart a workspace, or share a snapshot.

Note: if you are doing this locally you can [download the MongoDB Community Edition here](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-community/)

If you fork this repository, please ignore the lines above as the `.gitpod.dockerfile ` and `.gitpod.yml` files have already been configured before hand.

Next, edit README.md and change the `<username>`in the following line of markdown to your Github username such that you can click the button to open Gitpod.
